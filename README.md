# interview
Work done for job hunting startup in 2017. Since then, my work was apparantly removed. 
This was an experiment in applying DAO in PHP. I worked on the back-end, while someone else did the front end. Objects are in 'core', and interfaces & functions are in 'data'. Sadly, front-end is not organized.

This is an abandoned project.
